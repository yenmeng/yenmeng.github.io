Hi! I'm Yen Meng (孟妍). I'm a first year Ph.D. student at the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) (ILCC), School of Informatics, the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) (UoE), supervised by [Prof. Hao Tang](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/htang2/index.html). My research interests lie in self-supervised learning (SSL) for speech processing.

Previously, I completed my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/). I obtained my M.S. from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/), under the supervision of Prof. [Lin-Shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) and Prof. [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php), at the Speech Processing and Maching Learning Lab.
