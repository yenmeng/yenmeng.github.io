Hi! I'm Yen Meng (孟妍). I'm an incoming CS Ph.D. student at the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) (ILCC) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) (UoE). My current research interests fall in self-supervised learning (SSL) for speech processing. In the past, I worked on several topics including:
- data bias in speech SSL pre-training
- computational cost reduction of speech SSL models

Previously, I completed my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/). I obtained my M.S. from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/), under the supervision of Prof. [Lin-Shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) and Prof. [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php), at the Speech Processing and Maching Learning Lab.
