Hi! I'm Yen Meng (孟妍). I'm an incoming Ph.D. student at the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) (ILCC) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) (UoE). My current research interests fall in self-supervised learning for speech processing.

I obtained my master's degree from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/), in the Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering (GICE), under the supervision of Prof. [Lin-Shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) and Prof. [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php).

I received my bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering (EE) from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/), in 2021.
